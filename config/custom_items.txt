# Custom items go here. They are modifications of existing paths; look at the example for details.
# Item will spawn if the target has one of the req_titles and if their on-spawn ID has the required access level.
# req_access is going to be a shit to maintain since the config file can't grab constants and has to use integers, use it minimally.
# Separate titles with a single comma and a space (', ') or they'll bork.

item_name: tagged-up trenchcoat
item_desc:  A heavy, canvas trenchcoat meant for all-weather use. Over the years, someone has meticulously covered almost every inch of the coarse fabric with patterns, logos, messages, and patches. The left arm appears to be covered in painted-on, diagonal red-white stripes, while the other has been completely covered in a crude drawing of rosethorns with a permenant marker. The back of the coat is similarly decorated, with a myriad of crude scribbles and (mostly explicit) phrases in Gutter. NO REST FOR THE WICKED can be seen scribbed across the rear shoulder with big, white letters.

item_desc: A customisation kit with all the parts needed to convert a RIG.
kit_name: Jake Hale's Rig Module
kit_desc: A RIG controller that seems a little more bulky than most, with a certain comformation to the man's spine not normally seen among RIGs. The plating of the suit itself seems expertly welded with the tech fitted between to an even higher degree. The camera lenses along the right side of the face seem to move independently of one another, flicking about as though to scan the wearer's surroundings without turning the head.
